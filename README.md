i just generated 20000 discord token and Discord [Mail Access] Accounts

ill u have just to do check the tokens with the discord token cheacker witch is ill put in this page

# Guide for [Mail Access] : 

**for make access accounts u need to test Try it one by one cuz there is no app or script for checking [Mail Access]  (as far as I know) 

**all [Mail Access] will be in a txt file named (discord maill acc)**

**now lets talk about the tokens 

**Guide for TOKENS! :

**i just paste all 20000x tokens in a txt file named (20000 x Verified tokens)

**all u have to do just change the name of txt file to (tokens.txt)

**when u done with that download the token checker 

**require : npm install

**after that u need to run the checker with node index.js Command

**It takes time to check tokens

**when its done check your output folder and u can find Verified Tokens

**DONE

**if u have any question dm me : PG_VIKI#0160
